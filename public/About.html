      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        GreenRoots began in 2018 as a local initiative by a group of passionate residents who saw an opportunity to turn an unused lot into something meaningful. Through grants, donations, and lots of love, the space has grown into a thriving hub of greenery, education, and community spirit.
